"""platform settings table — app_settings

Revision ID: 0005_settings_table
Revises: 0004_people_cameras_events
Create Date: 2026-07-08

The baseline migration was generated before ``edge.settings.models`` was imported on
Base.metadata, so the platform ``app_settings`` table (backing GET /settings/public
and the Settings pages) was never created in this scenario's DB — every settings read
500s. This migration registers that model and create_all(checkfirst)s the missing
table, leaving all existing tables untouched.
